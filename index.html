  <h1>A Study on Population and Crime Correlation</h1>

  <p>By Beris Pena</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Graph 1 provides an informative visual on the largest states in the nation by population size sampled from the years 2017 and 2018. Graph 2 provides information on all the homicides spanning from 2013 to 2018. My goal is to spot a correlation between population and homicides to demonstrate that population size does lead to greater crime rates leading to the years 2017 and 2018. While researching I realized that in 2013 to 2018 there was a jump on the counts of homicides overall but from 2017 to 2018 even though the population count rose, crime rates dipped by a marginal rate. This study has shown that crime rates and population size might be independent of one another although one would assume that the bigger the population size, the greater the likely-hood of there being more crimes committed.</p>
